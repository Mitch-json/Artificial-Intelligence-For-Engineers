# Artificial Intelligence for Engineers

**Artificial Intelligence for Engineers** is a collection of hands-on implementations that demonstrate how core AI algorithms can be applied to solve real-world engineering problems. The repository explores how engineers can use search, optimization, and knowledge representation techniques to model complex systems, make intelligent decisions, and improve operational efficiency.

From foundational graph traversal algorithms like **BFS** and **DFS**, to advanced reasoning approaches such as **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)** and **Knowledge Graphs**, this project bridges the gap between **AI theory** and **engineering practice** â€” offering practical, code-driven insights into how artificial intelligence can transform modern engineering.
